3. Write program to find first n Disarium numbers and Disarium numbers between two given numbers.

A number is said to be Disarium if it is equal to sum of its digits raised to the power of their respective position in the number. 
For example, 135 is a Disarium number. Because, it is equal to sum of its digits raised to the power of their respective position.

135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3
135 = 1 + 9 + 125

code:

def is_disarium(n):
    return n == sum(int(d)**(i+1) for i, d in enumerate(str(n)))

print("First 10 Disarium numbers:")
count = 0
    if is_disarium(n):
        print(n, end=' ')
print("\n\nDisarium numbers between 100 and 200:")
for i in range(100, 201):
    if is_disarium(i):
print(i, end=' ')
